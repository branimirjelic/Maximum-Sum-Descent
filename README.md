# Maximum-Sum-Descent
Starting from the top of a pyramid of numbers, you can walk down going one step on the right or on the left, until you reach the bottom row. You can compute the total of the numbers you have seen in such walk. Problem is to find the maximum total among all possible paths from the top to the bottom row of the triangle.<br>
